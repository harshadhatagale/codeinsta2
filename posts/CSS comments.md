&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CSS *comments* are simply phrases or sentences within CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) that are rendred in browser or simply that are not displeyed on web browser. They served as notes or explanations for developers.
For example:
```css
/* Styles for body tag */
body{
    width: 100vw;
    background: black;
}
/* Styles for Posts */
.posts{
    width: 250px;
    height: 50px;
}
```

## Why *comments* are important in CSS ?

Comments in code, including CSS, are needed for documentation, code understanding, debugging, collaboration, code maintenance, educational purposes, leaving temporary notes, and excluding code. They enhance readability, facilitate communication among developers, and provide valuable context for both current and future work on the codebase.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything between /* and */ is considered as comments.There basically two types of comments:

* Single-line comments:
 Single comments are enclosed within syntax /* and */.
 
 For example:

 ```css
/* This is single-line comment */
```

* Multi-line comments:
 Multi-line comments are also defined as same as single-line comments.
 
 For example:

 ```css
/* This is
 multi-line comment 
 */
```
